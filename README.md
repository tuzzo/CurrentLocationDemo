# CurrentLocationDemo

A simple Android project that shows how to get the current location of the device. BE CAREFUL: read the comments in the code!!

## Requirements

Add PlayService dependency in gradle file (the Module one) - eventually also add the maven url in the project gradle file.

## License

There is no license on this code because is just an exercise I do for myself. I just hope this helps someone.
